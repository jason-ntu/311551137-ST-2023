# (d) If possible, give a test case that results in an error state, but not a failure. If not, briefly explain why not. (You also need to answer expected and actual output.)
    # This is impossible because wherever the error state is met, there must be some zero-element in x, and the value of count would be affected, thus leading to a failure.

# (e) For the given test case in (d), describe the first error state. Be sure to describe the complete state.
    # There is no test case provided in (d).
