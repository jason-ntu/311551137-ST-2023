The five methods tested are: __init__(self, capacity), enqueue(self, o), dequeue(self), is_empty(self), is_full(self)
The following characteristics have been identified and are used to generate tests for the methods:
C1: capacity >= 0
C2: input non null object
C3: queue is empty
C4: queue is full
Each characteristic has a boolean partition.
